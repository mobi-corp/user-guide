### Real-time GPS tracking software

## Getting started

![Landing Screen](/img/landing-screen.png)

To access **mobi.Locate**, click the blue truck icon labelled **Locate** on the landing page.

## Analytics

### Summary view

![mobi.Locate summary view](/img/locate/locate-ss-summary.png)

The **Analytics** portion of **mobi.Locate** allows the user to view past data, which can be used to research and perform trend analyses. The summary screen shows the **actual**, **month to date**, **quarter to date** and **year to date** for **revenue**, **cost**, **distance**, **time**, **visits** and **drivers** for the selected date range.

Changing the date range date range and clicking “**Apply**” updates the metrics for that particular date range. 

By clicking a metric, you can view more in-depth data broken down by **company**, **branch**, and then **driver**. 

## Live map

![mobi.Locate tabs](/img/locate/locate-ss-tabs.png)


To view the **live map**, click the **Maps** tab at the top right of the screen in **mobi.Locate**. 


### Branches 

![mobi.Locate map](/img/locate/locate-ss-map-branch.png)

On the map you will see a blue square where your branch is located. Click the blue square. A pop-up window will appear with the branch name. To view the branch live, click **View This Branch Live**.

You can also click a branch by clicking the tree symbol located in the green bar at the top of the screen. This will bring up a drop-down menu where you can click which branch you want to view.

### Drivers

![mobi.Locate driver location](/img/locate/locate-ss-map-driver.png)

Once you’ve selected a branch location, you’ll be able to see the location of your vehicles on the map marked by a blue truck icon.

Selecting any of the truck icons on the map will create a pop-up window over the truck. This window will list the **driver name**, **vehicle ID**, **VIN number**, **last recorded speed**, the **last updated timestamp**, and the **location**.

### Driver search

![mobi.Locate driver search](/img/locate/locate-ss-driver-search.png)

You can also search for drivers using the driver drop-down menu at the top of the map.

If you notice a truck icon on the map that is **gray**, this could mean several things. The most common reason is the vehicle hasn’t been active for over an hour. If you notice a gray vehicle that has been gray for an extended period of time, and you know that the vehicle has been driven in this time period, contact [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}) for further investigation.

## Features of live map

### Traffic view

![mobi.Locate traffic view](/img/locate/locate-ss-traffic.png)

mobi's live map uses **Google Maps**, meaning many of the features are the same.

The **traffic** feature, if turned on, will show the status of traffic in the area. On roads, green is for light traffic, orange is for moderate traffic, and red is for heavy traffic.

To turn the traffic feature on or off, click the **Traffic tab** in the **top right of the map**.

### Satellite view

Drag and drop the icon on any of the highlighted blue roads. To receive better results, we recommend zooming in on the road you want to view before dragging and dropping the orange man icon.

To exit out of street view and return back to the map view, click the **gray X** at the top right of the screen.

In the pop-up window, click the blue link that is labeled **[Driver Name]'s Trips So Far Today**. This will take you to the driver scorecard.

A driver scorecard will show you the history of a driver’s stops already completed for that particular day. You can also view the previous day’s trip by **changing the date** at the top of the map.

If you don’t see trips for a particular driver, it may be because they haven’t completed their first trip of the day, or they **didn’t have any trips** planned for the day.

If you have further questions about drivers or trips on the scorecard, please contact [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}) with information on the driver and the date in question.

### Historical Map

![mobi.Locate start POI](/img/locate/locate-ss-scorecard-start.png)
