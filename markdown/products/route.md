#Route Planning Software

### [See FAQ](/route/faq)

## Getting started
![](/images/route-ss-1.jpg)

To get started, select the level you wish to create a plan for.  Select the date range that you want to view if
it’s not currently selected by using the arrow buttons or by clicking on the date itself to use the date picker.  

To create a new plan, click the button on a day that does not already have a plan created.  
If a day already has a plan created that has not been [committed](#committing-a-plan), you have the option to continue editing it or 
replace it with a new plan. 

## Driver setup

By default, the Customize Drivers option is set to *On*. This setting allows you to add a unique **start and end address** 
for each individual driver as well as their [shift, overtime](#), and [service types](#).  You can enter the 
information on this step or you can add the data in [mobi.Resource](/resource) so that the next time you create or edit a 
plan, the driver data is automatically prefilled for a faster plan setup. 
 
Regardless of whether you are using Customized Drivers, you can also edit the **Driver Default** data fields to be 
used for any driver who does not have existing addresses. If a driver does have existing addresses, they will 
override the defaults.

Turning off the Customize Drivers option requires a pre-determined number of drivers to create routes for.

## Adding planned visits
![](/images/route-ss-4.png)

You can enter plan visits manually or copy-and-paste from a spreadsheet with properly formatted visit information. 
All fields are required except for Service Type and Time Window. 

> Warning: Choosing the spreadsheet option will wipe out any visits you've already entered and replace it with 
the new data.

Make sure when importing data from a spreadsheet that your plan visits follow the required column format used in 
mobi.Route

## Adding planned visits from a spreadsheet

[Download template spreadsheet](/documents/route_template.xlsx)

Adding visits from spreadsheet: 
 
> POI Name / POI Address / Service Type ID / Preferred Driver ID / Start Time / End Time / Duration

## Configuring plan settings

You can select a plan goal from three options– Minimize distance travelled between POIs, minimize late arrivals to jobs, 
or a balance of the two.

If you're unsure which plan goal is the best option based on your business model, you can click **Compare Plan Goals** 
to get a quick comparison overview of the resulting metrics for each plan option.

As you go through the plan set-up, make sure all required fields for the drivers you've entered and all required fields 
for visits (all but preferred driver, service type, and time window) are filled.
