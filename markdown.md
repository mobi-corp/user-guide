# H1: You start the page with me

## H2: I'm special! 

### H3

#### H4

##### H5

###### H6

This is regular paragraph text.  This text is **bold** and so is __this__ one.

This text is *italic* but so is this _this_ one.  These __*words*__ are **_both_**.

Here is how an external [link](http://www.mobicorp.com) looks and [this](#h2-im-special) is one on the page.

This [link](/) goes to the homepage and [this](/route) one goes to *Route*.

If you have a question, you can email me at [tbizaca@mobicorp.com](mailto:tbizaca@mobicorp.com).

Do you want to write  
something short that breaks lines  
like this without

a huge gap?  
**There are two spaces after the lines that you want to break without starting a new paragraph.**
